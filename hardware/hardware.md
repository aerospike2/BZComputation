# Hardware

The 3D printed parts (.stl) were desgined with Onshape.<br/>
Both of the platforms are covered with opaque arcylic sheets to minimise reflection of the solution from direct light.

## Liquid Handling

All the pumps operated were from [Tricontinent C-Series Syringe Pumps](https://www.gardnerdenver.com/en-gb/tricontinent/c-series-syringe-pumps) with T Valve 3-port. The [syringes](https://www.gardnerdenver.com/en-gb/tricontinent/syringes) used were 5 ml for the ferroin indicator and 12.5 ml for the rest of the solutions. The tubes were 1/8 in PTFE Tubing.<br/>

## DC motors 
The DC motors are separated into two categories, namely: <br/>
(i) [Cell-motors](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/dc-geared-motors/8347675?cm_mmc=UK-PLA-DS3A-_-google-_-PLA_UK_EN_Automation+%26+Control+Gear_Whoop-_-DC+Geared+Motors_Whoop-_-PRODUCT_GROUP&matchtype=&pla-341179612256&s_kwcid=AL!7457!3!413164772306!!!g!341179612256!&gclid=CjwKCAiAnfjyBRBxEiwA-EECLLOxfyEWQI48JPJwKeyX3iATBWEGEihnJxriuzLXfxe1rH9PmNmegRoCBV8QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) <br/>
(ii) [Interface-motors](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32780746288.html)<br/>
The motors are then coupled with the magnet holders which then allow the magnetic stirrers to be controlled by modulating the PWM signal generated by the electronics.<br/>
The cell-motors were stirred in clockwise manner whilst the interface-motors were stirred in anti-clockwise to ensure the bidirectional flow of the solutions.


## Imaging platform 
Cameras used in both platforms are [logitech C920 HD PRO WEBCAM](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/hd-pro-webcam-c920) <br/>
The height of the cameras from the experimental platforms are as followed:<br/>
1D Platform: 20.5 cm <br/>
2D Platform: 33.4 cm <br/>
This ensures the total coverage of the platform evenly.
